# [Layer Three Basic Implementation](https://squarism.com/2024/05/05/a_network_in_rust_part_1/)

1. use `cargo test` to test the modules
2. use `cargo run` to run the project
   1. If you uncomment `write_pcap()` function, you will get the `.pcap` file which you can open in wireshark and see the `ping` (ICMP) protocol details you created in this implementation.

**Note**: This is the example to see how networking works based on layer three protocol - ICMP
